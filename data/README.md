# Data

The data in this study comes from dynamically downscaled global climate models from the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The climate models were [dynamically downscaled](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/downscaling-cmip6) to a higher resolution signal using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations across the western United States.

Intial raw hourly temperature data from climate models was obtained and resampled to an annual maximum series using [Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/).

The hourly temperature data is from two global climate models (CESM2 and CNRM-ESM2-1) and encompasses historical and future projected (from the SSP3-7.0 scenario) data ranging from 1980 to 2100.

Data is formatted as netCDF datasets.
